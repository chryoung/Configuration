#+TITLE: GTD Note System Documentation
#+AUTHOR: GTD Master
#+STARTUP: overview

* Overview

This is a plain-text GTD (Getting Things Done) system built with Emacs Org-mode.
It uses a minimal file structure to avoid creating thousands of files while
maintaining easy navigation and powerful features.

* Directory Structure

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
~/org/
├── inbox.org           # Quick capture, unsorted items
├── projects.org        # Active projects with tasks
├── someday.org         # Someday/maybe items
├── archive.org         # Completed items archive
├── journal/
│   ├── 2025.org        # One file per year
│   ├── 2026.org        # (daily entries as headings)
│   └── ...
└── review/
    ├── weekly.org      # Weekly reviews
    └── monthly.org     # Monthly retrospectives
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Journal Structure

Each year has ONE file. Days are organized hierarchically:

* Daily Workflow

1. Morning: =SPC o j= to open today's note
2. Review yesterday's incomplete items
3. Use =SPC o t= to move unfinished TODOs to today
4. Add new TODOs: =SPC o c d=
5. Work through tasks, clock time with =SPC o i= / =SPC o O=
6. Add notes throughout the day under "Notes" section

* Weekly Review (Every Sunday)

1. =SPC o c w= to start a weekly review
2. Review completed items in agenda
3. Process inbox items (=SPC o r= to refile)
4. Review projects and update NEXT actions
5. Review someday/maybe list

* Monthly Review (End of Month)

1. =SPC o c m= to start a monthly review
2. Review weekly reviews from the month
3. Archive completed projects
4. Update goals and priorities
5. Review someday/maybe for items to activate

* Tips

** Finding Past Work
- Use =SPC /= (search in project) within ~/org/
- Use org-agenda date navigation
- Use outline folding to navigate year → month → day

** Clock Reports
In any org buffer: =SPC m t R= generates a clock report table

** Archiving
Move completed items to archive: =SPC m s A=

** Tags
Use tags for context: =@home=, =@work=, =@phone=, =@computer=
Filter agenda by tag: =SPC o a= then =/= to filter

* Maintenance

** Yearly
- Create new journal file automatically (handled by the system)
- Archive old completed items

** Monthly
- Review and clean up someday.org
- Check projects for stale items

** Weekly
- Process inbox to zero
- Review all projects
